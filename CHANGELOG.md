## [0.2.0] - 2015-03-25
### Added

- Added _Gemnasium_, plus _Coveralls_ and _Code Climate_ integration (and hence improved code test coverage).
- Added functionality to handle releasing the `GVL` for any _file_ and/or _I/O_ operations.
- Added ability to `Magic#flags_array` to return name of each flag that is set.
- Added na√Øve synchronization via `Mutex#lock` and `Mutex#unlock` methods to make interactions with _libmagic_ more thread-safe.
- Added ability for _Travis CI_ test against multiple versions of vanilla _libmagic_.
- Added _LLVM_ (`clang`) compiler to build with to _Travis CI_, and fixed various issues reported by `clang` compiler during build-time.
- Added ability for `Magic#load` to take nil as valid argument.
- Added support for the `MAGIC_CONTINUE` flag so that `Magic#file`, `Magic#buffer` and `Magic#descriptor` methods will return an _array_ for multiple results when appropriate.
- Added rudimentary `Vagrantfile` that can be used to build a development environment.
- Added the `Guard` Ruby gem for convenience, with an appropriate `Guardfile`.

### Changed

- Re-factored the _API_ and cleaned up small portions of code and documentation.
- Changed `Magic#version_array` and `Magic#version_string` methods to be a singleton methods.
- Renamed the `Magic#flags_array` method to `Magic#flags_to_a`.
- Changed the `Magic::new` method, so that it accepts an array of paths from which to load the _Magic_ database.
- Moved integration with _File_ and _String_ core classes into separate namespace.
- Changed the behavior not to catch the generic `Magic::Error`, plus always to raise on errors coming from _libmagic_. This is to make it more aligned with the standard library, where _file_ and _I/O_ related errors would raise an appropriate exception.
- Changed behavior consistent among various versions of _libmagic_ adhering to the _POSIX_ standard. This concerns the following _IEEE 1003.1_ standards:
  - http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/utilities/file.html
  - http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/file.html

### Fixed

- Fixed formatting and white spaces.
- Fixed _Travis CI_ build against _Rubinius_.
- Fixed setting of global `errno` value to avoid race conditions.
- Fixed issue with _libmagic_'s regular expression (`regex`) library not working with _UTF-8_ (or any other wide-character encoding).
- Fixed build to make it work with _C++_ compilers.
- Fixed any _C90_ standard related build-time warnings.
- Fixed version number to comply with _Semantic Versioning 2_ (http://semver.org/).

### Deprecated

- Retired support for Ruby 1.8.x (no support for _MRI_, _Ruby Enterprise Edition_ and _Rubinius_).
- Retired testing with Ruby _1.9.2_ and _2.1.0_, and added _2.2.0_ on _Travis CI_.
- Removed forward declaration of `errno` as it's not needed on systems with modern _C/C++_ libraries and compilers.
- Removed the `-Wl,--no-undefined` option from `LDFLAGS`, as they might break on some systems.

## [0.1.0] - 2014-03-21
### Added

- First version of Magic.
